# Aquabot

As we were sitting around during our second fair, thirsty for water in the hot sun, we wondered if we could build a robot to bring water to us, rather than having to get water ourselves. And such, the Aquabot was born. We an old powered wheelchair donated to us, and we added remote controls and a cooler with a dispenser and bill acceptor.

## Drive Controls

The first thing we did with the wheelchair was to figure out how to get it to move. The original electronics required a key, and we did not have the charger. We decided instead to rip them out, and add our own. We wanted the Aquabot to be completly safe, so we put a bumper on the front, along with an emergency stop button, that completly disabled movement when hit. The only way to renable it was with either a key or to open the electronics box and flip a switch. We found a nice motor controller to control both motors, and could take inputs directly from the hobby reciever that we were using for remote control. We later added a microcontroller between the reciever and the motor controller in order to smooth out the controls and use a button on the remote as a driving eneable.
